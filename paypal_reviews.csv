This idea should be the standard. And add middle names into the cards. It'll give more security. To get back into an account can you add in that a picture of your identification card/ driver's license gets used and it also looks at the issued date. And it also can take a picture of your debit card and it looks at the expiration date. Everyone knows how to tell which cards are the most current. This will protect the customer. üòâ,idea standard add middle names cards give security get back account add picture identification card driver license gets used also looks issued date also take picture debit card looks expiration date everyone knows tell cards current protect customer,positive

Paypal's customer support's negligence almost got me scammed. I requested them to verify a transaction based on transaction id inorder to know if i am dealing with a legit sender. But they ignored my request and was too lazy to check the transaction id. I specifically asked them to verify the id two times from the screenshot that the sender provided. The screenshots clearly has my name in it. But it can be edited into it. Hence i seek help from paypal support. But they neglected my request. üëé,paypal customer support negligence almost got scammed requested verify transaction based transaction id inorder know dealing legit sender ignored request lazy check transaction id specifically asked verify id two times screenshot sender provided screenshots clearly name edited hence seek help paypal support neglected request,positive

Paypal sucks. When you lock your card you still get your money stolen and when you dispute it or try to get your money back for something you didn't even have. They pretty much tell you to screw off because they don't want to refund the money stole by them.

Paypal needs to get their Pay in 4 feature under control. Customer service claims they have no access to fix system errors or why things decline.

You get a $ credit limit and as you pay more loans off it increases with guaranteed approval up to that dollar amount listed.
